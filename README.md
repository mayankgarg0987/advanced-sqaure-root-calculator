# advanced-sqaure-root-calculator

This is a program written in Python version 3 to calculate square root of a number.<br />
I was given a homework but I made it more advanced just for fun.<br />
It includes some topics -
- file handling 
- exception handling
- functions
- classes and objects 
- while loop
<br />
